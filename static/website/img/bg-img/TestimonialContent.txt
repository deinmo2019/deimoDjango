Sincerely, I can't begin to sum up the benefits the deinmo software app has given to me personally as a lecturer, particularly the "70%
attendance recognition and verification software". As a lecturer in the department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the app has been immensely useful, as
I have been able to automatically and swiftly taken accurate and secured attendance for my students thereby eliminating the stress in taking
pen-paper manual attendance system. All thanks to DeinmoAppSoftware.

When I saw the website while surfing the net, I was doubtfull at first in trying out their web training programme. But after giving it a try, I was glad I finally did. Initially, I was zero in 
the use of java, c++ and python languages. I couldn't even code a simple print out statement. My grades were dropping and so I had to find alternative learining platforms to see if that could boost my knowledge and grades in computer programming. And yes it did, after
completing the training, I was able to score distinctions in the subsequent programming courses I took while in the university. The classes were fun and exciting, so many dedicated tutors and real life examples to get you 
acquainted with the programming world. Please subscribe to their training package. You won't regret it!

Carry go o, Deinmo Team!

As one who is both a teacher and a pastor, the deimmo software app for creche, nursery, primary and secondary schools have had enormous success in students' result delivery,
passing out information to parents/guardians, monitoring students' performance, computing results. Infact everything from scratch to finish in school administration
is inbuit in the application. The fact that the software is offline even made it more handy and less complex for my staff to use. I highly recommend their services.

We know how the oil industry in the 21st century is connected to the digital world. Mordern day oil and gas equipment require some sort of embedded software algorithms with suitable control to drive systems. 
In retrospect to our past collaborations, I recommend deinmo team's services to any one who is willing to learn and apply the language of software in solving real world problems from art to engineering and all
other spheres of the human experience that requires software automation and control.
